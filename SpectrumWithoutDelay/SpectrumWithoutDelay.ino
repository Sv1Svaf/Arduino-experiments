/* Blink without Delay
 
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to a digital  
 pin, without using the delay() function.  This means that other code
 can run at the same time without being interrupted by the LED code.
 
 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground.
 * Note: on most Arduinos, there is already an LED on the board
 that's attached to pin 13, so no hardware is needed for this example.

// constants won't change. Used here to 
// set pin numbers:
const int greenpin =  10;      // the number of the green LED pin
const int redpin =  11;        // the number of the red LED pin
const int bluepin =  12;        // the number of the blue LED pin

// Variables will change:
int greenState = LOW;             // greenState used to set the LED
int blueState = LOW;             // greenState used to set the LED
int redState = LOW;             // greenState used to set the LED

long previousMillis = 0;        // will store last time LED was updated

// the follow variables is a long because the time, measured in miliseconds,
// will quickly become a bigger number than can be stored in an int.
long interval = 1000;           // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

void setup() {
  // set the digital pin as output:
  pinMode(greenpin, OUTPUT);      
}

  // check to see if it's time to blink the LED; that is, if the 
  // difference between the current time and last time you blinked 
  // the LED is bigger than the interval at which you want to 
  // blink the LED.

      blueState = HIGH;
      redState = LOW;
     }
